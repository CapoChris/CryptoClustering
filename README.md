# CryptoClustering

This project explores the use of unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify distinct groupings of cryptocurrencies based on select market attributes. The analysis is conducted using a cleaned dataset of active cryptocurrencies that are currently being mined and traded.

The process includes standardizing the data, reducing its dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and applying K-Means clustering to group similar cryptocurrencies together. The results are visualized to provide a clearer understanding of how the cryptocurrencies cluster in reduced-dimensional space.

This analysis serves as a foundational exercise in clustering financial data and interpreting high-level patterns within the cryptocurrency market.
